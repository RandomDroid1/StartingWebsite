<p>Digits is a cat who is full of nothing but pride and fury. He was adopted in 2020 along with his brother, Oliver. He loves to be pet and carried, as long as it is not in the prescense of other people
    or cats. He can be very sweet, but he also holds grudges. You will know if you have wronged him in some way.
